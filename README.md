## Overview

The Content-Based Recommendation System is designed to recommend products to users based on the textual features of the products, such as product names, descriptions, and product specifications. The system uses pre-trained models to encode textual data into embeddings and then calculates similarity scores to make recommendations.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Sentence Transformers
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)

You can install the required Python packages using pip:


## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the code files to your local machine.

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):


3. Activate the virtual environment:

- On Windows:


- On macOS and Linux:


4. Run the recommendation system with your data:

```python
# Create an instance of the recommendation system
recommender = ProductRecommendation()

# Fit the recommender with your data
recommender.fit(df)

# Make recommendations and enter exact product name
product_name = 'Product_Name'
recommendations = recommender.predict(product_name)

for rec in recommendations:
    print("->", rec)
```


This README provides an overview of the content-based recommendation system, its requirements, how to get started, and usage instructions.
